# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer
First, you need to create a context object.
Secondly, you will render the .provider property (this is a component) that came from the context object you just created. This provider component will be used to wrap around the component you want to give access to the context.
Lastly, now we can use the context that has been passed down from the context provider to its descendents.

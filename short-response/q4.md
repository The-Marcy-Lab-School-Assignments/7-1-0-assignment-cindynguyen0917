# Question

Consider this `InstagramContextProvider` component below.

**Question:** When using the "Global Context Provider" pattern, what will the `children` be? In other words, what component will this `InstagramContextProvider` be wrapped around?

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import InstagramContext from "./InstagramContext";

const InstagramContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [totalLikes, setTotalLikes] = useState(0);
  const incrementTotalLikes = () => setTotalLikes(totalLikes + 1);

  const contextValues = { totalLikes, incrementTotalLikes };

  return (
    <InstagramContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
      {children}
    </InstagramContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default InstagramContextProvider;
```


# Answer
The children in the InstagramContextProvider represent any components that will be wrapped by the provider. The children could be any components that need access to the context but when using a global context provider pattern, you would typically wrap the root component of your application--commonly known as the app. This is because app typically holds all of the components you need for your application, making thme descendents of app with access to the context.
